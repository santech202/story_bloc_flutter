<h3><strong>The Teling Service</strong></h3>



<p>We agree to provide you with the Teling Service. The Service includes all of the Teling products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Teling's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):</p>

<ul><li><strong>Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.</strong><br>People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Teling, based on things you and others do on and off Teling.</li><li><strong>Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.</strong><br>We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other  Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.</li><li><strong>Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.</strong><br>Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.</li><li><strong>Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other  Company Products.</strong><br>Teling is part of the  Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the  Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the  Company Products.</li><li><strong>Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.</strong><br>To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by  Inc.,  Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.</li><li><strong>Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.</strong><br>We use data from Teling and other  Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Teling.</li><li><strong>Research and innovation.</strong><br>We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.</li></ul>
